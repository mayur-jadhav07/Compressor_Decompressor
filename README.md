# Compressor_Decompressor
Project Description:
The primary objective of this project is to employ compression techniques to effectively reduce the required number of bits for data representation, while ensuring the preservation of data integrity through the use of lossless conversion methods. By employing solely lossless compression techniques, the project aims to eliminate any potential loss of data during the compression process.

The utilization of compression techniques in this project offers several advantages, including the conservation of storage space, acceleration of file transfers, and reduction in costs associated with storage hardware and network bandwidth. These benefits contribute to improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness in data management.

One crucial aspect of this project is the emphasis on maintaining data integrity. All compressed files produced through the employed compression techniques must be capable of being restored to their original form accurately, ensuring no loss of information during the decompression process.

Through the successful implementation of this project, we anticipate significant advancements in data compression, enabling enhanced storage efficiency, streamlined file transfers, and cost savings in storage infrastructure and network bandwidth utilization.

Tech stack: Java, JavaSwing.

IDE: Apache NetBeans
